### Welcome :wave:

I am José, and I am currently working as a Data Science Senior Manager at Santander UK, where I am overseeing the model development lifecycle within the assets and liabilities sides of the bank's portfolio – these include **pricing optimisation**, **attrition modelling**, and **customer segmentation** :computer: :bar_chart:

In this repository expecte to see personal projects related to data science, machine learning, financial mathematics, BI, and anything interesting that crosses my mind :thinking:

Outside of work and coding, I love to:

- Read books about history, economics, finance, and fiction (thriller, mystery, drama) :book:
- Travel around the world and trying new cuisines as well as attempting to replicate the recipes :earth_asia: :cook:
- Burn the food by practising sports, namely football (or soccer for others) and running :soccer: :running:
